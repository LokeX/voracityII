Welcome to Town hall! As a politician your highest calling
is to take poor peoples time, money and lives enriching
you and your owners so you - most importantly - don't have
to suffer the conseqences of the pillage.

Welcome to the Casino where the odds are always against you,
though we'll cuddle you so thoroughly, that you'll enjoy
being robbed. Until of course you're sober, broke single and
homeless; but then you'll be a loser, so nobody cares (nobody
being you - and the rest of the losers).
